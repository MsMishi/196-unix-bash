#Chapter 1.3:
#Exercise 1: According to the man page, what are the official short and long descriptions of echo #on your system?
$ echo [-n] [string ...] #short
$ echo -- write arguments to the standard output

#Exercise 2: By reading the man page for echo, determine the commmand needed to print out "hello" without the trailing newline, and verify using your terminal that it works as expected.
$ echo -n "hello"
hello[~]$
