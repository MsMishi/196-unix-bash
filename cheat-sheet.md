I am using the iTerm terminal shell as my on boarding mentor suggested. I have read that it will be very useful further down the line and I trust her judgement. These are the bash shortcuts I have found most useful thus far.

echo [string]:	#Print string to screen$
man [command]:	#Display manual page for command
"⌃C"	Get out of trouble
"⌃A"	Move to beginning of line
"⌃E"	Move to end of line
"⌃U"	Delete to beginning of line
"⌥ -click"	Move cursor to location clicked
"↑↓"	Scroll through previous commands
"⌃L"	Clear screen
"⌃D"	#Exit terminal
"⇥" Auto-completes a unique word
