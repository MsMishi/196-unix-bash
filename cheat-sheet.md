I am using the iTerm terminal shell as my on boarding mentor suggested. I have read that it will be very useful further down the line and I trust her judgement. These are the bash shortcuts I have found most useful thus far.

"⌃C or Ctrl-C"	Get out of trouble
"⌃A or Ctrl-A"	Move to beginning of line
"⌃E or Ctrl-E"	Move to end of line
"⌃U or Ctrl-U"	Delete to beginning of line
"⌥ -click or Option-click"	Move cursor to location clicked
"↑↓ or up and down keys"	Scroll through previous commands
"⌃L Ctrl-L"	Clear screen
"⌃D Ctrl-D"	Exit terminal
"⇥ or tab" Auto-completes a unique word
"! or bang" repeats a command
"⌃R or Ctrl-R" searches through previous commands
